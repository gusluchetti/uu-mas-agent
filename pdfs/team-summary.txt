Group 7 Team Overview

Sergio Kazatzidis: Came up with most of the acceptance and bidding strategy, helped me out during the development process.

Shreyes Jishnu: Coded a little on first attempt at opponent modelling, helped out on all the reports.

Tóth Bendéguz: Helped with the literature on the earlier reports and tested the agent for the final report.

Tim Brouwer: Helped writing the first two reports but left the group unexpectedly. :(

Gustavo Luchetti (me): Coordinator, coded a lot of the bidding strategy and refactored Sergio's code for the acceptance strategy.

Group was good! Everyone wrote a little for the last report, I feel like I could've delegated the issues between members a bit better, but the group worked well, especially in the last few days where everyone was eager to get things done.
